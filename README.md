# VoxelEngine
Voxel Engine created with C++ and OpenGL, that I work on in my spare time.

Features:
  - 32 x 32 chunks
  - 1 Texture
  - Face culling
  - Fly-around controls:
  
    - w,a,s,d for moving forward, the the left, backward, and to the right respectively.
    - Left shift to go down and space to go up.
    - Use the mouse to look around.
